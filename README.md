# writer
A writer for the command line. Based heavily upon [note.sh](https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh) - "A simple shell script for managing your random daily notes."

## Installation
Install with this cumbersome command:
```
(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smcalilly/writer/main/download.sh | WRITER_DIR='writer' bash) && cd "$WRITER_DIR" && .src/install.sh
```

This will download all the code, then walk you through some steps to setup your writer. WRITER_DIR should be the name of the directory where all your writing lives. 

## Working with it
If you want to make an alias for the command, in your shell's startup file, add:
